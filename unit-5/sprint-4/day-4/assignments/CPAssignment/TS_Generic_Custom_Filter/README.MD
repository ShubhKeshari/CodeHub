## Description:-

- In the template there is a Function named `Filter`.

- This Function will take a Generic Type argument.

- This Function will also take an Array as a Parameter. The array should of Type Array of the generic argument.

- Let's say I pass type `number` as the generic argument, the array should be of type `number` only.

- The `Filter` method will also take a callback function as a Parameter.

- This `Filter` should work just like the build-in array.filter the only difference should be that it takes the array as a parameter.
