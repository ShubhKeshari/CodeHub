- please make sure you do not push package-lock.json
- Download and unzip the boilerplate
- Navigate to the correct path
- Run **npm install** to install the node modules
- Run **npm test** for the test cases.

## Boilerplate:-

- Do not change the given folder structure
- inside src folder you will code.ts file that is where you need to write the code.
- In src will be a file index.ts. Please make sure this file should be always empty
- you can find the testcase under `__tests__ ` folder.

## Description

- In the code.ts file there is a `Print` Function.

- Make `Print` a TS Generic function that takes a interface as Generic Type and a Prameter with the same type as the Generic Parameter.

- So let's assume I pass an interface `TypeA` to the `Print`, in that case the parameter of Print should also be of type `TypeA`.

## General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug before itself
- we also request you to not to just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
