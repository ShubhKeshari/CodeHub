### You haven't been taught Cypress to run the test cases locally; you can see the passed/ failed test cases and test errors on CP itself.

## Some Rules to follow:-

- Before writing a single line of code, please read the problem statement very carefully.
- <span style=" color: red">Don't change the already given IDs or classes.</span>
- If you don't follow these rules, you might not get any marks even if you do everything correctly.

## Problem statements

- Use `fetch` for API requests 
- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

### <h1 style="color:#215dc8">index page</h1>

Your task is to build ***`BookApp`*** app where different Books are available, and you have to perform all `CURD` operations here, able to create, update, Read, and Delete Books and also implement search functionality.

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 1. List of Books on page load [3]
</h4>

On page `load`, a list of all `Books` should be shown in the  `div#data-list-wrapper`. 

Expected markup (Books card list):
<!-- ![landingpage markup]() -->
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ztnGSVH.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>landingpage markup</b></figcaption>
</figure>

- The `div.card` is a card appended to the div with `div.card-list`.
- In the above markup you can see only 5 cards are present on the first page and each page limit is 5.
- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

Expected markup (example, single card div inside card-list div): 
<!-- ![BooksMarkUp]() -->

Problem 2. Pagination [2]
</h4>

<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6j7soZQ.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>

</figure>

- The buttons for pagination should be appended inside the `div` with `id=pagination-wrapper"` which is already mentioned in the boilerplate
- add _limit = 5 i.e. on each page `5` Book should be there
- At the start, 4 buttons must be there (we have a total of 20 objects in the db.json file, and using limit=5 need to create 4 buttons)
- pagination should be dynamic as when we *add* a new Book the pagination button should increase. `(i.e from 4 to 5)`
- **Hint** : 
    1. `?_page={pagenumber}&_limit=5`
    2. use `res.headers.get("X-Total-Count")` for finding totalCount no of pages
- Note:- name the class names and data-testid as mentioned in the image provided above(markup)

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 3. Ability to add new Book [2]

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 7. Sorting books Based on Price
</h4>

- Sorting for `Low to High` UI:
<!-- ![sort Low to high] -->
<figure>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Il19ls0.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px; object-fit: cover;" width="40%"/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Il19ls0.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px; object-fit: cover;" width="40%"/>
</div>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>sort Low to high</b></figcaption>
</figure>


With the click of the button `#sort-low-to-high`, the book list should be sorted in ascending order based on their *price*.

With the click of the button `#sort-high-to-low`, the book list should be sorted in descending order based on their *price*.

You may use any approach of your choice for sorting. You may sort the available data, or you may make a new fetch request to the server and update the list. In case you want to fetch data, please use the [JSON Server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 8. Filtering books based on the genre [1]
</h4>
 You have to create two types of filters as

 1. ***Science fiction***
 2. ***Fantasy***
- Filtering for `Fantasy` UI:
<!-- ![filter Drama] -->

<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dCtr3ot.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Filter for  "Fantasy"</b></figcaption>
</figure>

When the button `#filter-science-fiction` is clicked, the book list is expected to be filtered. It should only show the books whose `genre` is ***`Science fiction`***.

When the button `#filter-Fantasy` is clicked, the book list is expected to be filtered. It should only show the books whose `genre` is ***`Fantasy`***.

You may use any approach of your choice for filtering. You may filter the available data, or you may make a new fetch request to the server and update the list. In case you want to fetch data, please refer to the [JSON Server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).


- <span style=" color: green">No need to complete functionality for simultaneously working of filter and sorting operations</span>

- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 9. Search by title/author
</h4>

- To implement search functionality on top there is a select tag with *options* to search by title/author  

1. ***`title`***
<!-- ![search by title] -->

<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BIsp5PC.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Search by title and `The Hobbit` as search query</b></figcaption>
</figure>

 2. ***`author`***

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eoesbgx.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Search by author and `Harper Lee` as search query</b></figcaption>
</figure>






A select tag (`select#search-by-select`) with options as
  1. title
  2. author is already created

Every time you have to select an eighter option, next to it there is an input box (`input#search-by-input`) You have to enter the title/author if it is included in the title/author respectively show the book only after clicking a search button(`button#search-by-button`)

You may use any approach of your choice for search functionality. You may use the available data or you may make a new fetch request to the server (with params as ***`?${title/author}_like=${title of book/author of book}`***) and update the list. In case you want to fetch data, please refer to the [JSON Server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). 


***Note***:- Get the updated data from API after the POST, PATCH, or DELETE request is done.

### General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes to respond,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- We also request you not just submit it last minute
- Try to keep one submission at a time
- Use `${baseServerURL}/what-ever-route` for server url & not `localhost:9090/what-ever-route` in your solution. Failing to do so may cause all the tests to fail.
